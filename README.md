Here goes my very first Rails project. Very exciting! I'm building a site for a Arlington Paving & Sealcoating, one of Texas's top [Local Asphalt Companies](http://www.asphaltpavingarlingtontx.com) who requires a special app to be developed using rails. 

This is not the first site I've built for local paving companies around Arlington Texas but it's definitly the first rails project for one! Typically when I work with one of the local asphalt contractors, I use WordPress to build the site in an effort to dominate local search and generate leads for the company I'm working with. But now we're working on something a bit more advanced that requires something like rails to build. 

I'm excited to work with one of the best paving companies in Arlington, Texas who happens to serve a 50 mile radius providing commercial and residential paving in Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Harlingen and the Dallas For Worth Area. 

## Local Asphalt Companies - a challenging phrase

My job working the Arlington Paving & Sealcoating is not only to build an amazing website and custom application to help run their business – it's also to generate leads mostly through Adwords and with Adwords, I've learned that 2 of the best phrases to get traffic for are [Local Paving Contractors Arlington](http://www.asphaltpavingarlingtontx.com/) and [Arlington Sealcoating Companies](http://www.asphaltpavingarlingtontx.com/)

It's a challenge but I love it. Now time to build this amazing rails app so I can add more value to the companies I work with!

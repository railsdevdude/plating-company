# README

I'm working on a new rails project for a national [Plating Comapany](http://mpp.net/process/plating/) called Mirror Polishing & Plating Company Inc. The company specializes in chrome roll plating, polishing, grinding and surface finishing. 

This is my first time working with a plating company and I have to say it's quite an experience. I initially built them a wordpress website and now they are requesting that I build a custom application with rails to handle chrome plating projects. The plating process is quite fascinating actually and I'm learning a lot. Mirror Polishing & Plating Company Inc. is actually one of the only facilities in the U.S. (their facility is over 85,000 sq ft!) that can handle rolls up to 12 ft in diameter and 50 ft in length.  

It's exciting to not only help MPP with their website and marketing but to also get an inside look into this industry, their process and their incredible facility. In addition to hard chrome plating, MPP also does roll surface finishing, roll repair, roll fabrication and roll grinding (they have precision roll grinders). My job is to build their online presence and bring in the right kind of traffic for these search terms. 

## MPP – A Leading Plating Company

Mirror Polishing & Plating Company Inc. are leaders in their industry but it is still a challenge to get the right traffic to their site. We're attempting to bring in visitors for phrases such as [Industrial Chrome Plating](http://mpp.net/process/plating/) but it's a challenge. 

As challenging as it is, I'm excited to be working with this amazing roll plating company and look forward to growing together!
